This is some boilerplate for training the Art Classification dataset on TPU. 

The original link is [here @ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time).
A like on that dataset as well as the [TPU version](https://www.kaggle.com/alexanderlav/tpu-bestartworksofalltime) would surely be appreciated!

The dataset has been stratified by target and split 80/20. 

Any multilabels have been reduced to the first label.

If there are any issues with the google storage "gs" link, you can generate new ones from the Kaggle TPU version [here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexanderlav/tpu-bestartworksofalltime). 

To generate new gs links, try opening a new notebook from that Kaggle Dataset, and then: 
```
from kaggle_datasets import KaggleDatasets
GCS_DS_PATH = KaggleDatasets().get_gcs_path()
```
The easiest links to use are the "train2" and "test2" .tfrecord files (represented in this repository's notebook)

You may also need to connect your Google account (though hopefully not). Here's the boilerplate incase you need to do the research for how to do that:

```
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient
user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()
user_credential = user_secrets.get_gcloud_credential()
user_secrets.set_tensorflow_credential(user_credential)
```
